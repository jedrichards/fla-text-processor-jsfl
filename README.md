# HogarthAutomationJSFL

JSFL scripts for automating the processing of banner FLAs for translation.

## Outline

The JSFL scripts run within the Flash IDE environment and operate on FLAs. They are also capable of parsing and outputting XML and publishing SWFs. During processing for translation an FLA is taken as input and then scanned for translatable text which is outputted as XML. The XML can then be translated by a 3rd party and finally imported back into the FLA.
